Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: ndi-zyaːHk-ir-á̲ o-mu-ndaré u-angú ci-ongo
Gloss: SM1SG-build-APPL-FV AUG-NP3-maize PP3-POSS1SG NP7-storage
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘I am building a storage for my maize.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Multiple object markers are not allowed when two or more object markers refer to an inanimate object. This is illustrated with the sentence in (\ref{bkm:Ref488927201}), containing two inanimate objects. It is possible to express either of these objects with an object marker, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref74907372}) and (\ref{bkm:Ref74907373}), but not both, as the ungrammaticality of (\ref{bkm:Ref74907374}) shows.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
