Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: N-pansí
Gloss: NP9-grasshopper
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘grasshopper’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: /sh/ is occasionally realized as prenasalized /nsh/ in words where comparative data and reconstruction suggest that the sound was never prenasalized, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref98923934}--\ref{bkm:Ref98923939}). The prenasalization may be related to the preceding /m/, though as seen in (\ref{bkm:Ref494184788}--\ref{bkm:Ref494184790}), variation between prenasalized and non-prenasalized fricatives also occurs outside this context.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
