Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: Speaker-2: adu, Ø nakal
Gloss: ... oh.no! ... be.mischievous
The English translation of this sentence is: [Speaker 1: ah, that Petrus!]  Speaker-2: oh no!, (he’s) \textbf{mischievous}’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: As a \isi{causative}, \isi{bivalent} \textitbf{biking} ‘make’ is used with \isi{monovalent} bases. Semantically, this \isi{causative} type stresses the causer’s manipulation of circumstances, which leads to the caused event or effect. That is, \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives are causer-controlled, with the causee having no control. Therefore, causatives with \textitbf{biking} ‘make’ are formed with \isi{monovalent} non-agentive bases, or with \isi{monovalent} agentive bases with inanimate or with animate but helpless causees. This is shown in ({\ref{Example_11.62}) to ({\ref{Example_11.67}). Overall, though, \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives are rare in the corpus.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 2:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: ana~ana biking pusing mama
Gloss: RDP~child make be.dizzy mother
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘the kids \textbf{worry} (their mother)’ (Lit. ‘\textbf{make to be dizzy / confused}’)
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: As a \isi{causative}, \isi{bivalent} \textitbf{biking} ‘make’ is used with \isi{monovalent} bases. Semantically, this \isi{causative} type stresses the causer’s manipulation of circumstances, which leads to the caused event or effect. That is, \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives are causer-controlled, with the causee having no control.

Question 3:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: siang Ø jalang, trus malam Ø duduk menyanyi sampe jam dua
Gloss: day ... walk next night ... sit sing until hour two
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘(during) the day (I) \textbf{went} (over there), then in the evening (I) \textbf{sat about} (and) \textbf{sang} (songs) until two o’clock (in the morning)’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Causatives with agentive bases are unacceptable. This is due to the fact that \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives focus on the causer’s manipulation of circumstances itself while the causee has no control. This is illustrated with the unacceptable \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives in ({\ref{Example_11.66}) and ({\ref{Example_11.67}), which are formed with \isi{monovalent} dynamic \textitbf{duduk} ‘sit’ and \isi{bivalent} \textitbf{makang} ‘eat’, respectively. The two elicited examples contrast with the corresponding \textitbf{kasi}{}-causatives in ({\ref{Example_11.56}) and ({\ref{Example_11.60}).
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 4:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: sa di bawa, Roni kas duduk sa di atas
Gloss: 1SG at bottom Roni give sit 1SG at top
The English translation of this sentence is: [A ten-year old boy on a truck-trip:] ‘I was down (in the cargo area, but) Roni \textbf{enabled} me \textbf{to sit} on top (of the cab)’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Causatives with agentive bases are unacceptable. This is due to the fact that \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives focus on the causer’s manipulation of circumstances itself while the causee has no control. This is illustrated with the unacceptable \textitbf{biking}{}-causatives in ({\ref{Example_11.66}) and ({\ref{Example_11.67}), which are formed with \isi{monovalent} dynamic \textitbf{duduk} ‘sit’ and \isi{bivalent} \textitbf{makang} ‘eat’, respectively.
