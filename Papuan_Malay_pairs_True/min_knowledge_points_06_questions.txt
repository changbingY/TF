Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: ... tida perna dia liat, ko sungay ko bisa terbuka begini
Gloss: ... NEG once 3SG see 2SG river 2SG be.able be.opened like.this
The English translation of this sentence is: [Seeing the ocean for the first time:] ‘[never before has he seen, what, a river that is so very big like this ocean,] never before has he seen \textbf{you}, \textbf{you river} can be wide like this?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Modification with numerals typically involves the \isi{numeral} \textitbf{dua} ‘two’, as with short \textitbf{tong} ‘\textsc{1pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.16}), but constructions with \textitbf{tiga} ‘three’ are also found. In the corpus, \isi{modification} with quantifiers is limited to universal \textitbf{smua} ‘all’ and mid-range \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’, as shown with long \textitbf{kamu} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.17}) and long \textitbf{dorang} ‘\textsc{3pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.18}), respectively. Modification with other quantifiers is also possible, as shown with midrange \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’ in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_6.19}). The examples in (\ref{Example_6.16}) to (\ref{Example_6.19}) also demonstrate that the numerals and quantifiers always occur in post-head position. That is, they cannot occur in pre-head position as illustrated with the elicited ungrammatical constructions in (\ref{Example_6.20}) and (\ref{Example_6.21}). (In this respect pronouns differ from nouns in that \isi{noun} phrases with adnominally used numerals or quantifiers can have an \textsc{n-mod} or a \textsc{mod-n} structure, as discussed in §\ref{Para_8.3}.)
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 2:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: sa su pukul dia di kamar
Gloss: 1SG already hit 3SG at room
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘I already hit \textbf{her} in (her) room’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Modification with numerals typically involves the \isi{numeral} \textitbf{dua} ‘two’, as with short \textitbf{tong} ‘\textsc{1pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.16}), but constructions with \textitbf{tiga} ‘three’ are also found. In the corpus, \isi{modification} with quantifiers is limited to universal \textitbf{smua} ‘all’ and mid-range \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’, as shown with long \textitbf{kamu} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.17}) and long \textitbf{dorang} ‘\textsc{3pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.18}), respectively. Modification with other quantifiers is also possible, as shown with midrange \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’ in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_6.19}).
