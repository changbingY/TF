Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Yauyos Quechua. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: vaka-y wira wira-m matray-pi pu√±u-shpa allin pastu-ta miku-shpa-m
Gloss: cow-1 fat fat-EVD cave-LOC sleep-SUBIS good pasture.grass-ACC eat-REFL-EVD
The English translation of this sentence is: My cow is really fat, sleeping in a cave and eating good pasture grass.
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Evidentials do not appear in commands or injunctions~(\ref{Glo6:Ruwaruchun}); finally, only one evidential may occur per clause~(\ref{Glo6:Vakay}).
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
