Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: Mék a sé wán wɔ́d.
Gloss: SBJV 1SG.SBJ QUOT one word
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘Let me say one word.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The transition from a more lexical reading of sé to a more functional one is far from clear-cut (which is why I have opted for a unitary gloss of ‘\textsc{quot}’ in all contexts). First, distributional restrictions set sé apart from the true speech verbs tɔ́k ‘talk, say’ and tɛ́l ‘tell’. For instance, sé does not normally take a nominal object, as does tɔ́k. Compare \REF{ex:key:1368a} and \REF{ex:key:1368b}.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 2:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: A sé=an kwík.
Gloss: 1SG.SBJ QUOT=3SG.OBJ quickly
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘I said it quickly.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Beyond that, adverbials do not usually modify sé ‘\textsc{quot}’ \REF{ex:key:1369a}. Adverbials only appear as quoted complements indexed by sé (b). Again, there is no restriction on adverbial modification of the speech verb tɔ́k ‘talk, say’ (c):
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
