Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: (Nó) nátín nó dé dé.
Gloss: NEG nothing NEG BE.LOC there
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘Nothing is there.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: In verbal clauses, the negative indefinite pronoun nátin must be used with a preceding negative quantifier nó ‘\textsc{neg’} as well as with support from verb negation. This holds for both the subject and object position. Since nátin is inherently negative, its use in verbal clauses therefore invariably involves the use of double negative concord. Compare the indefinite \textsc{NP} sɔn tín ‘something’ \REF{ex:key:557} with the subject and object negative indefinite pronoun nátin ‘nothing’ in \REF{ex:key:558} and \REF{ex:key:559} respectively:

Question 2:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: Dís sɔ́nde (nó) bɔ́di (nó) dé na strít.
Gloss: this Sunday NEG body NEG BE.LOC LOC street
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘This Sunday, nobody is in the streets.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The negative indefinite phrase nó mán ‘\textsc{neg} man’ = ‘nobody’ is equally common as nó bɔ́di ‘nobody’ (\ref{ex:key:561}–\ref{ex:key:562}). The third logical alternative, nó pɔ́sin ‘\textsc{neg} person’ = ‘nobody’, is rare in the data:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 3:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: Dís sɔ́nde (nó) bɔ́di (nó) dé na strít.
Gloss: this Sunday NEG body NEG BE.LOC LOC street
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘This Sunday, nobody is in the streets.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The affirmative counterparts of the negative indefinite phrases in (\ref{ex:key:561}–\ref{ex:key:562}) are indefinite (quantifier) phrases involving pɔ́sin ‘person’ and mán ‘man’, which function as indefinite pronouns:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 4:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: \'{U}s=káyn hós dɛn ték plɛ́nk bíl?
Gloss: Q=kind house 3PL take board build
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘Which (kind of) house did they take board to build?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: However, fronting\is{fronting} of the patient object of the major (open class) verb in ték SVCs is not accepted \REF{ex:key:612}. Patients are usually questioned in situ in their original syntactic position following the major verb \REF{ex:key:613}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 5:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: \'{I}n na wán Annobón gɛ́l wích yú?
Gloss: 3SG.INDP FOC one PLACE girl bewitch 2SG.INDP
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘(*She) a girl from Annobón bewitched you?’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: By comparison, the insertion of a \textsc{3sg} peronal pronoun is ungrammatical in the focus construction in \REF{ex:key:700}, since na/nóto is non-referential in these constructions. Likewise, a cleft focus construction cannot be rephrased as a presentative clause (cf. \sectref{sec:7.4.4}):
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 6:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: Na bíg wé e bíg.
Gloss: FOC big SUB 3SG.SBJ big
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘It’s really big.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The predicate cleft construction in \REF{ex:key:733} features a stative verb, the property item bíg ‘be big’. Like other cleft constructions, predicate cleft does not require marking of the out-of-focus part of the sentence as a relative clause\is{relative clauses}. This is, in fact rejected in unison by all speakers who were asked about this possibility \REF{ex:key:734}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 7:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: Na lúk fáyn yu lúk.
Gloss: FOC look fine 2SG look
The English translation of this sentence is: You looked really well.
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Sometimes verbs are clefted together with a pronominal object \REF{ex:key:735}. If this is the case, the pronominal object is not repeated with the second verb. The fronting\is{fronting} of a subject or adverbial modifier together with the verb is not accepted \REF{ex:key:736}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 8:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: In mamá bí rusa.
Gloss: 3SG.POSS mother FOC Russian
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘Her mother is Russian.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The two asymmetries in the formation of copula clauses next to negative suppletion (i.e. \ref{ex:key:767} and \textsc{3sg} default reference, i.e. \ref{ex:key:766} and \ref{ex:key:768}) are complemented by a third asymmetry: Whenever overt \textsc{TMA} marking is required or the copula is employed in a context suggesting reduced finiteness\is{finiteness}, the copula verb bí \textit{\textsc{‘be’}} is made use of. This complementary distribution is strict. Therefore, a clause like the following one is ungrammatical, since bí may not appear in basic identity clauses without overt TMA marking. Compare \REF{ex:key:768} above and \REF{ex:key:770} below:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 9:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: In mamá bí rusa.
Gloss: 3SG.POSS mother FOC Russian
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘Her mother is Russian.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: In the following two equative clauses, the presence of the \textsc{TMA} markers dɔ́n ‘\textsc{prf}’ \REF{ex:key:771} and go ‘\textsc{pot}’ \REF{ex:key:772} motivates the appearance of the suppletive identity copula bí ‘\textsc{be’.} In spite of its defective distribution (cf. \ref{ex:key:770}), the copula bí behaves much more like a copula verb than na\textit{\textup{/}}nóto: It may take dependent personal pronouns (e.g. in \ref{ex:key:771}) and appear with TMA marking (e.g. \ref{ex:key:771} and \ref{ex:key:772}).
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
