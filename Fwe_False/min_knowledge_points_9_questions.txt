Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: zi-tiHiz-í̲te
Gloss: SM8-be_busy-STAT
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘They are dangerous.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: True stative verbs, which express a continuing, unbounded state, cannot be used in the stative construction, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref71287631}). A present state interpretation is achieved when a true stative verb is used in the present, as in (\ref{bkm:Ref72313519}).
Please only return True or False.

Question 2:
You are a linguist specializing in Fwe. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: ndi-a-shí-vurumat-i
Gloss: SM1-PST-PER-close_eyes-NPST.PFV
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘My eyes are still closed.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The persistive may also occur with past constructions, indicating that an event started before, and is still ongoing at the past time interval that is currently discussed. As persistive is a subtype of imperfective aspect, specifying the internal structure of the event, it may only co-occur with the remote past imperfective, in (\ref{bkm:Ref492375625}), or the near past imperfective, in (\ref{bkm:Ref492375626}). It may not co-occur with the near past perfective, as the ungrammaticality of (\ref{bkm:Ref492375627}) shows.
Please only return True or False.
