Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: banyak sagu
Gloss: many sago
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘lots of sago’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Mass nouns can be modified with quantifiers, which always occur in posthead position, as in (\ref{Example_5.7}) and (\ref{Example_5.8}). That is, the quantifiers cannot occur in prehead position, as shown with the elicited ungrammatical constructions in (\ref{Example_5.9}) and (\ref{Example_5.10}). Also, mass nouns cannot co-occur with numerals, neither in pre- nor in posthead position, as shown with the elicited ungrammatical examples in (\ref{Example_5.11}) and (\ref{Example_5.12}). (As for the position of adnominal quantifiers vis-à-vis their head nominal and the semantics involved, see §\ref{Para_5.10} and §\ref{Para_8.3.2}.)
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 2:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The postpredicate position is illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.167}) to (\ref{Example_5.170}). In clauses with peripheral adjuncts, the ad\isi{verb} follows the predicate and precedes the adjunct, such as \textitbf{nanti} ‘very soon’ in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.167}) and \textitbf{langsung} ‘immediately’ in (\ref{Example_5.169}). Clauses, in which the temporal ad\isi{verb} follows the peripheral adjunct are either ungrammatical, such as \textitbf{nanti} ‘very soon’ in the elicited examples in (\ref{Example_5.168}), or only marginally grammatical such as \textitbf{langsung} ‘immediately’ in the elicited contrastive examples in (\ref{Example_5.170}).
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 6:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  kamu orang-tua enak di sana skali
Gloss: ... 2PL parent pleasant at L.DIST very
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘you, the parents, (have) very pleasant (lives) over there’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The intensifier \textitbf{terlalu} ‘too’ also occurs in prepredicate position, as in (\ref{Example_5.187}). By contrast, \textitbf{skali} ‘very’ takes a postpredicate position, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.188}) to (\ref{Example_5.190}). In clauses with peripheral adjuncts, as in (\ref{Example_5.189}), \textitbf{skali} ‘very’ follows the predicate, such as \textitbf{enak} ‘be pleasant’ in (\ref{Example_5.189}). Clauses in which \textitbf{skali} ‘very’ follows the peripheral adjunct, as in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.190}), are ungrammatical.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 7:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  kamu orang-tua enak di sana skali
Gloss: ... 2PL parent pleasant at L.DIST very
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘you, the parents, (have) very pleasant (lives) over there’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The intensifier \textitbf{terlalu} ‘too’ also occurs in prepredicate position, as in (\ref{Example_5.187}). By contrast, \textitbf{skali} ‘very’ takes a postpredicate position, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.188}) to (\ref{Example_5.190}). In clauses with peripheral adjuncts, as in (\ref{Example_5.189}), \textitbf{skali} ‘very’ follows the predicate, such as \textitbf{enak} ‘be pleasant’ in (\ref{Example_5.189}). Clauses in which \textitbf{skali} ‘very’ follows the peripheral adjunct, as in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.190}), are ungrammatical.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 8:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  agak sa su besar
Gloss: ... rather 1SG already be.big
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘I was already rather big’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The diminishers \textitbf{agak} ‘rather’ and \textitbf{hampir} ‘almost’ also occur in prepredicate position, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.191}) to (\ref{Example_5.194}). Always directly preceding the \isi{verb}, \textitbf{agak} ‘rather’ modifies stative verbs, as in (\ref{Example_5.191}). Clauses in which \textitbf{agak} ‘rather’ precedes the subject, as in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.192}), are ungrammatical. Diminisher \textitbf{hampir} ‘almost’ typically modifies dynamic verbs, as in (\ref{Example_5.193}) and (\ref{Example_5.194}).\footnote{According to one consultant, some Papuan Malay speakers also use \textitbf{hampir} ‘almost’ to modify stative verbs. Much more often though they employ a construction with \textitbf{su mulay} ‘already start to’ as in (\ref{Footnote_Example_5.1}) below:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 9:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  orang itu ni percaya sama Tuhang Yesus
Gloss: ... person D.DIST D.PROX trust to God Jesus
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘this person there believes in God Jesus’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Papuan Malay also allows the stacking of demonstratives. Typically, only identical demonstratives are stacked, as in (\ref{Example_5.218}) and (\ref{Example_5.219}). To some degree, however, non-identical demonstratives can also be stacked, as shown in (\ref{Example_5.220}) and (\ref{Example_5.221}).\footnote{Juxtaposed \textitbf{ini ni} ‘\textsc{d.prox d.prox}’ and \textitbf{itu tu} ‘\textsc{d.dist d.dist}’ are not taken as instances of partial \isi{reduplication}. As discussed in §\ref{Para_4.1.2}, partial \isi{reduplication} of the stems \textitbf{ini} ‘\textsc{d.prox}’ and \textitbf{itu} ‘\textsc{d.dist}’ should result in the reduplicated forms \textitbf{in{\Tilde}ini} ‘\textsc{d.prox{\Tilde}d.prox}’ and \textitbf{it{\Tilde}itu} ‘\textsc{d.dist}{\Tilde}\textsc{d.dist}’, respectively. Therefore, \textitbf{ini ni} ‘\textsc{d.prox d.prox}’ and \textitbf{itu tu} ‘\textsc{d.dist} \textsc{d.dist}’ are taken as instances of \isi{demonstrative} stacking. Reduplication of demonstratives does occur, however, as discussed in §\ref{Para_4.2.5.2}.}
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 10:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  orang itu ni percaya sama Tuhang Yesus
Gloss: ... person D.DIST D.PROX trust to God Jesus
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘this person there believes in God Jesus’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: While unattested in the corpus, speakers do allow one combination of non-identical \isi{demonstrative} stacking in elicitation. Acceptable is the order of proximal \textitbf{ini} ‘\textsc{d.prox}’ followed by short distal \textitbf{itu} ‘\textsc{d.dist}’, as shown in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_5.220}). The reverse order is not permitted by speakers even in elicitation, as illustrated in (\ref{Example_5.221}). At this point in the research on Papuan Malay, however, the semantics of ``\textsc{n} \textitbf{ini tu}'' constructions as compared to ``\textsc{n} \textitbf{ini ni}''' and ``\textsc{n} \textitbf{itu tu}'' constructions remain uncertain.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 11:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  sa tinggal di sana yang paling di bawa itu
Gloss: ... 1SG stay at L.DIST REL most at bottom D.DIST
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘I live over there that’s the furthest down’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: In their pronominal uses the locatives substitute or stand for \isi{noun} phrases, as illustrated with the four elicited contrastive examples in (\ref{Example_5.222}). Distal \textitbf{sana} ‘\textsc{l.dist}’ in (\ref{Example_5.222b}) substitutes for the \isi{noun} phrase \textitbf{ruma yang paling di bawa itu} ‘that house that’s the furthest down’ in (\ref{Example_5.222a}). The ungrammatical construction in (\ref{Example_5.222c}) shows that the \isi{locative} replaces the entire \isi{noun} phrase and not only its nominal head \textitbf{ruma} ‘house’.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
