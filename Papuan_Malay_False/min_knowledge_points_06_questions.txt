Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Papuan Malay. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence:  dua tong mandi, pas Nofita de datang
Gloss: ... two 1PL bathe precisely Nofita 3SG come
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘the two of us were bathing, at that moment Nofita came’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Modification with numerals typically involves the \isi{numeral} \textitbf{dua} ‘two’, as with short \textitbf{tong} ‘\textsc{1pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.16}), but constructions with \textitbf{tiga} ‘three’ are also found. In the corpus, \isi{modification} with quantifiers is limited to universal \textitbf{smua} ‘all’ and mid-range \textitbf{brapa} ‘several’, as shown with long \textitbf{kamu} ‘\textsc{2pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.17}) and long \textitbf{dorang} ‘\textsc{3pl}’ in (\ref{Example_6.18}), respectively. Modification with other quantifiers is also possible, as shown with midrange \textitbf{banyak} ‘many’ in the elicited example in (\ref{Example_6.19}). The examples in (\ref{Example_6.16}) to (\ref{Example_6.19}) also demonstrate that the numerals and quantifiers always occur in post-head position. That is, they cannot occur in pre-head position as illustrated with the elicited ungrammatical constructions in (\ref{Example_6.20}) and (\ref{Example_6.21}). (In this respect pronouns differ from nouns in that \isi{noun} phrases with adnominally used numerals or quantifiers can have an \textsc{n-mod} or a \textsc{mod-n} structure, as discussed in §\ref{Para_8.3}.)
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
