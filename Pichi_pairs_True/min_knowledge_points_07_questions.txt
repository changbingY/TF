Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: In verbal clauses, the negative indefinite pronoun nátin must be used with a preceding negative quantifier nó ‘\textsc{neg’} as well as with support from verb negation. This holds for both the subject and object position. Since nátin is inherently negative, its use in verbal clauses therefore invariably involves the use of double negative concord. Compare the indefinite \textsc{NP} sɔn tín ‘something’ \REF{ex:key:557} with the subject and object negative indefinite pronoun nátin ‘nothing’ in \REF{ex:key:558} and \REF{ex:key:559} respectively:
