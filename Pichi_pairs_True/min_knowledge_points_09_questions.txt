Question 1:

Sentence: A fía sé dɛn go bɛlɛ́ mi pikín fɔ mí.
Gloss: 1SG.SBJ fear QUOT 3PL POT impregnate 1SG.POSS child PREP 1SG.INDP
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘I feared that they could impregnate me my child.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Intransitive verbs may only appear with a subject\is{subjects} and may not take objects\is{objects}. Participants other than subjects appear in the guise of prepositional phrases\is{prepositional phrases}. For instance, the locomotion verbs fláy ‘fly’ and wáka ‘walk’ are intransitive. The use of theme\is{theme} \REF{ex:key:1080} or goal\is{goal} objects \REF{ex:key:1081} is rejected as ungrammatical:

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The verb fɛ́t ‘fight’ cannot take an object either \REF{ex:key:1090}. A comitative participant needs to be expressed as a prepositional phrase \REF{ex:key:1091} or within a coordinate structure \REF{ex:key:1092}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.

Gloss: NAME with NAME 3PL IPFV fight
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘Djunais and Boyé are fighting.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The verb fɛ́t ‘fight’ cannot take an object either \REF{ex:key:1090}. A comitative participant needs to be expressed as a prepositional phrase \REF{ex:key:1091} or within a coordinate structure \REF{ex:key:1092}:

With both property items, a valency-increasing causative construction is required in order to add a participant in addition to the subject \REF{ex:key:1097}{\fff}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 6:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.

Gloss: (...) but 3PL own fine 3SG.SBJ fine PREP see
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘(...) but theirs is beautiful, it [the wedding ceremony] is beautiful to see.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: At this point, a word is in order on the raising properties of expletive verbs. In \REF{ex:key:1152} below, the \textsc{3sg.sbj} pronoun e anaphorically refers to dɛn yón ‘theirs’, so the object of the complement clause beginning with the non-finite complementiser fɔ ‘\textsc{prep}’ has been raised into subject position in the main clause. For other speakers, however, raising is not accepted with evaluative verbs \REF{ex:key:1153}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 7:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The verb fíba ‘resemble’ takes full complement clauses\is{complement clauses} introduced by the complementiser sé \REF{ex:key:1154}. Neither reduced fɔ{}-complement clauses nor SVCs are accepted in clause linkage. Hence, an SVC like \REF{ex:key:1155} is ungrammatical:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 8:
You are a linguist specializing in Pichi. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.

Gloss: 2SG have.to send 1PL.INDP=3SG.OBJ
The English translation of this sentence is: ‘You have to send it to us.’
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The bulk of Pichi verbs can occur with one as well as two objects\is{objects}. The primacy of the object next to the verb – which is usually animate and has the role of recipient\is{recipient} or beneficiary – is evident in double-object constructions involving two object pronouns. The presence of two pronominal objects is ungrammatical if the clitic object pronoun =an is preceded by the low-toned personal pronoun una/unu ‘\textsc{2pl}’ or another \textsc{3sg.obj} pronoun =an (for details, see \sectref{sec:3.3}, on tone-conditioned suppletive allomorphy). In such cases, it is the patient object that remains unexpressed. Compare the double-object construction in \REF{ex:key:1199} with the ungrammatical example \REF{ex:key:1200} and sentence \REF{ex:key:1201}. In the latter example, the \textsc{3sg.obj} theme\is{theme} object =an remains unexpressed:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: The bulk of Pichi verbs can occur with one as well as two objects\is{objects}.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Nevertheless, like other inherently reciprocal verbs, mít and mítɔp may take part in a reciprocal alternation (cf. also fɛ́t ‘fight’ in \ref{ex:key:1090}). The two participants may be expressed as coordinate subject{\fff}s in an intransitive clause while reciprocity is understood. Compare the transitive use of mít ‘meet’ in \REF{ex:key:1315}, with its intransitive use with two coordinate subjects in \REF{ex:key:1316}:
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
