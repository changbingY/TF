Question 1:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: kánâ mɛ kɔ̀bɛ-H ndáà tsì mɛ̀ɛ́ lémbo-lɛ
Gloss: or 1SG.PST1 break-R also emptyset7.interdiction 1SG.PRS.NEG know-NEG
The English translation of this sentence is: `[You were telling me to do so.] Or I also broke the interdiction, I don't know.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Another argument for verb derivational suffixes and inflectional morphology belonging to different categories comes from their distribution: aspect and negation markers are in complementary distribution and cannot co-occur, as shown in \REF{VSuff3}. Although \REF{VSuff3a} and \REF{VSuff3b} would be ungrammatical no matter what since they have a conflict in their tense categories (-{\itshape lɛ} negates the present and {\itshape mɔ̀} occurs only in past tenses), \REF{VSuff3c} illustrates that the co-occurrence of aspect and negation in a complex predicate is ungrammatical even within the same tense category.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.

Question 4:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: áà mɛ nzíí ná làwɔ ná
Gloss: yes 1SG PROG.PRS still talk still
The English translation of this sentence is: `Yes, I am still talking.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Under this distributive function, {\itshape sílɛ} `finish' can only be used with plural subjects and only in certain contexts. For example, \REF{Nsile11}, where the event distributes over the different participants is grammatical, whereas \REF{Nsile12}, which has a singular subject, is ungrammatical.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 5:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: gyí bí ya-H tfúga ya-H tfúga-H nà gyí
Gloss: what 1PL.SBJ 1PL-PRS suffer 1PL-PRS suffer-R COM what
The English translation of this sentence is: `What do we suffer, we suffer from what?.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Under this distributive function, {\itshape sílɛ} `finish' can only be used with plural subjects and only in certain contexts. For example, \REF{Nsile11}, where the event distributes over the different participants is grammatical, whereas \REF{Nsile12}, which has a singular subject, is ungrammatical.

Question 6:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: mɛ nzíí kɛ̀ nà vúlɛ-H H-le-vúdũ̂ nà le-vúdũ̂ mɛ-H táálɛ-H sílɛ nyùlɛ
Gloss: 1SG PROG.PRS go COM take.away-R OBJ.LINK-le5-one COM le5-one 1SG-PRS begin-R finish drink
The English translation of this sentence is: `I'm taking down [palm trees] one by one, I start to drink [them] up [make palm wine out of them].'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: Under this distributive function, {\itshape sílɛ} `finish' can only be used with plural subjects and only in certain contexts. For example, \REF{Nsile11}, where the event distributes over the different participants is grammatical, whereas \REF{Nsile12}, which has a singular subject, is ungrammatical.

Question 7:
You are a linguist specializing in Gyeli. You are given a sentence along with its morpheme breakdown, gloss, and translation. Words are separated by spaces, and morphemes are separated by hyphens. Based on your understanding, please judge whether the sentence is grammatical or ungrammatical.
Sentence: áà sílɛ-H kɛ̀ nà dvùwɔ-H dyúwɔ
Gloss: 1.PST2 finish-R go CONJ stuff-R ∅7.top
The English translation of this sentence is: `He has gone and stuffed the top [with straw],'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: \noindent A singular participant is, however, grammatical even with {\itshape sílɛ} `finish' if there are several events over which the aspect marker is distributing. \REF{sile3} shows a coordinated clause where the first constituent is almost identical to the ungrammatical phrase in \REF{Nsile12}. The second constituent adds another event, however, over which {\itshape sílɛ} can distribute, thereby making \REF{sile3} acceptable.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
