Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: All these verbs can also take a different lexeme as an object, as for instance, in \REF{Cogna}. They cannot appear without an object, as \REF{Cognb} shows.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: {\itshape mànjìmɔ̀} is sensitive to a mass/count distinction in that it does not appear with uncountable nouns, neither liquids nor granular aggregates, as shown in \REF{wholeno}. Using {\itshape mànjìmɔ̀} with mass nouns requires a specification of the physical entity, for instance a bottle as in \REF{wholeno3}.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.

Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: In \REF{NCOM1}, both examples are excluded from \textsc{stamp} marker omission, based on the CV noun class prefix. In contrast, in \REF{NCOM2} with consonantal noun class prefixes, only the plural noun in \REF{NCOM2b} does not allow \textsc{stamp} marker omission, but its singular counterpart in \REF{NCOM2a} does allow it.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.

Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else. 

Question 6:

Sentence: mɛ lámbɔ̃́ɔ̃̀ kù
Gloss: 1SG trap.R.COMPL emptyset1.rat
The English translation of this sentence is: `I have (already) trapped the rat.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: While there are some verbs, as in \REF{absmo1}, which can take both the {\itshape mɔ̀} form and the contracted form, other verbs can only take one or the other. {\itshape lámbɔ} `trap', for instance, can only take the contracted form as in \REF{absmo2a}, while the non-contracted form in \REF{absmo2b} is judged as ungrammatical. It seems to be lexically determined whether a verb takes one or the other or both forms.
