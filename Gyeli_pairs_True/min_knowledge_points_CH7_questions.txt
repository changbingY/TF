Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: \subsubsection*{Predication types} Unlike all other copula types, the \textsc{stamp} copula agrees with the subject in gender, as discussed in \sectref{sec:AGRtargets} on agreement targets. The \textsc{stamp} copula can link a nominal subject to different predication types. In \REF{ID1a}, the predicate is nominal, expressing a classification relation: Ada is a member of the set of teachers.

The English translation of this sentence is: `The name of my village is Ngolo.'
Here is a relevant knowledge point for this example to help you judge: \citet{creissels2005} provides a useful survey of pronominal subject and object markers and their evolutionary stages in African languages. Following his model of three different stages in pronominal markers, Gyeli has both a stage I and a stage II pronominal marker for subjects. The stage I pronominal marker is the subject pronoun, as in \REF{SBJSCOP1}, which is in complementary distribution with its corresponding noun phrase and chosen for discourse structural reasons. In contrast, the stage II pronominal marker, following \citet{creissels2005}, is the \textsc{stamp} marker, as in \REF{SBJ1a}, which is obligatory even (in most cases) if a nominal or pronominal subject noun phrase is present. In contrast to subjects, non-subjects, namely objects and oblique noun phrases, only have a stage I pronominal marker, as described below.
Please only return True or False. Do not say anything else.
